# OmniConnect-ModelForge

This repository is an **umbrella project** for computational neuroscience tools and models.  
It is designed to integrate multiple approaches to studying brain networks across scales, from **directed connectomes** to **spiking neuron models**.

## Projects

### 1. Cross-Species Connectomics
**Path:** `projects/cross_species_connectomics/`  

Directed connectome framework integrating **mouse viral tracing** with **diffusion MRI** across mouse, marmoset, rhesus macaque, and human.  
Includes tractography shell scripts, connectome construction, statistical analyses, and figure generation from publication.
